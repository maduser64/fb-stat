# fb-stat

Simple Facebook group data crawler tool. - Enrico Ronconi <enrico.ronconi.p@gmail.com>

#Licensing
  I'm a poor electronic engineering student but I don't ask you money.
  The only thing that I ask you is **PLEASE GIVE ME CREDITS** by
  linking this page and/or writing somewhere my name if you are going
  to publish some data anlisys based on data retrieved using this script.
  Thank you, man.
  
#Usage
  The first part of the script contains the settings, make sure that
  everything is ok, then use:
  
  ```php fbstat.php group-id [mysql_table_name]```
  
  where:
   - group-id -> the facebook id of the target group.
   - mysql_table_name -> MySQL table name. Required only if you have choose
   to auto import data in a MySQL database.
   
#What it does
  This script dumps infos about posts in a specific given group.
  It saves that data into CVS file and (if required) it imports that data
  in a MySQL table automatically.
  
#How it works
  First, it send an http request to Facebook Graph API, then the response
  (given in JSON format) is parsed, and the data stored into CSV file.
  The response contains also a pointer to the next "page" of posts, so
  the script continues to parse the other page and so on until the end of
  the feed.
  
#Permissions
  To use this script you must provide a valid facebook user access token
  (you can genereate it, for example, using Graph API explorer).
  The permission required are:
  - **user-groups**, if using Graph API v2.3 or previous
  - **user-managed-groups**, if using for Graph API v2.4 or higher
  
  
  **IMPORTANT NOTE:**
  If you use Graph API v2.3 or previous, you can use an access token with
  user-groups permission to analyze groups, even secret, that **you are
  member of**.
  
  Unfortunately with API v2.4 the permission user-group was deprecated
  and you can only use user-managed-groups to analyze groups that **you
  are an _admin_ of**. Be a group moderator is **not** enough.
  
  So, in few words, you can use API <=v2.3 to analyze every group you
  are member of *BUT* you can not see reactions (they are available
  only for API >=2.6) and you know that old API versions will be
  discontinued.
  
  **OR**
  
  You can use the lastest API (v2.8, today) *BUT* you must be an
  admin of the group.
  
#Informations stored
  Currently, the information dumped are:
  - Post unique ID
  - Post author (unique ID and name)
  - Post type (eg. state, photo, link ...)
  - Post creation date
  - Total count of likes/reaction\* to the post
  - Total of comments to the post
  - Author (unique ID and name) of the first post comment (if any)
  
  \* **Reaction are available only with API v2.6 or higher**, for versions <= 2.5 only likes are counted.
    
#System requirements
  This script is designed do be ran in a unix-like system, anyway since
  PHP and MySQL can run under multiple OS, it maybe will work under
  Windows or other OS.

  This script was tested on a Rasperry Pi running raspian, with PHP 5.4.

#Progress
  This script saves data in real time into the CSV output file. It writes
  one line per post, so you can check in real time the number of post
  analyzed using, for example:
  ```wc -l out.csv```
